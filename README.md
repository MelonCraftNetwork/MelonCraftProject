What is " MelonCraft " ?

Well meloncraft is a minecraft pc edition server that was ported and is owned by ShaderGameing! Now if you dont know what a server is you can read more right here.

Minecraft Multiplayer:
Multiplayer on Minecraft is available through player-hosted servers and enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider. Single player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators, who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players around. Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed to enter the server.Multiplayer servers offer players a wide range of activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs. Competitions are available in some servers, in which players can participate in a variety of games, including some resembling The Hunger Games. A gamemode, PvP (player versus player), may be enabled to allow fighting between players. In 2013 Mojang announced Minecraft Realms, a server hosting service intended to enable children to run server multiplayer games easily and safely.

Now , Meloncraft is for public use. This server is for players to play minecraft together and have fun on a survival server. Hundreds of players from all around the world connect to this server everyday. This server is hosted on a vps ( Virtual Private Server). Now this server has been up and running for the past year and we have been looking for people to donate since this server has to be paid for every month. The server has various ranks that you can buy such as " V.I.P , Guard , GM " etc.. Meloncraft is now looking to expand. We are looking to find other server owners , plugin develpoers , web disgners , and server staff members. Now we will be updating this GitHub Repo atleast once every two weeks with plugins , mods , and new server info. We will also be making a server wiki with the top Minecraft Pocket Edition servers and Plugins. On that wiki we will also be adding various how to's and step by step guides on everything minecraft!
